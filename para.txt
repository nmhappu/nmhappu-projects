Wikis are enabled by wiki software
otherwise known as wiki engines
A wiki engine, being a form of a content management system
differs from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators
in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader
and wikis have little inherent structure
allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.
